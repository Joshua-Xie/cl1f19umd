## About this Course

Computational linguistics (CL) is the science of doing what linguists
do with language, but using computers. Natural language processing
(NLP) is the engineering discipline of doing what people do with
language, but using computers. We'll cover both, though the emphasis
is on NLP. We will largely focus on machine learning-based approaches
to a wide variety of challenging problems in NLP, with an emphasis on
recent deep learning-based tecniques.



## Prerequisites

The required prerequisite for this course in an undergraduate AI
course, though a machine learning course, an algorithms course, or
LING 689/889 (Computational Psycholinguistics) should be
sufficient. In particular, you should be able to:

- Program in python
- Use basic unix commands ([backgound](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs124/kwc-unix-for-poets.pdf))
- Function with basic probability and statistics ([background](http://hspm.sph.sc.edu/COURSES/J716/a01/stat.html))
- Apply basic linear algebra ([background](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/courses/2013S_ML/math4ml.pdf))

If you cannot handle all of these things (and cannot pick them up quickly), you should expect to run into challenges in the course.




## Grading

The components of grading are:

- Homework assignments (X%)
- In-class/piazza participation (X%)
- Projects (X%)
- Exams (X%)

On *participation*, you are to actively in class or on Piazza. If you participate on Piazza, every question you answer well will get you 1% credit (marked by "instructor approved answer"); every question you ask will get you 0.5% credit (marked as "good question" by the instructor or a TA). Asking/answering questions in class counts the same.

**Late-ness**: Late homeworks are not allowed without prior approval. Projects may be handed in two days late, but at a 25% (absolute) penalty.

If you handed something in and do not get a score for an assignment,
you have a one week moritorium to resolve this.



## Class Policies

**Disability Support:** Any student eligible for and requesting
reasonable academic accommodations due to a disability is requested to
provide, to the instructor in office hours, a letter of accommodation
from the Office of Disability Support Services (DSS) within the first
TWO weeks of the semester.

**Academic Integrity:** Any assignment or exam that is handed in must
be your own work. However, talking with one another to understand the
material better is strongly encouraged. Recognizing the distinction
between cheating and cooperation is very important. If you copy
someone else's solution, you are cheating. If you let someone else
copy your solution, you are cheating. If someone dictates a solution
to you, you are cheating. Everything you hand in must be in your own
words, and based on your own understanding of the solution. If someone
helps you understand the problem during a high-level discussion, you
are not cheating. We strongly encourage students to help one another
understand the material presented in class, in the book, and general
issues relevant to the assignments. When taking an exam, you must work
independently. Any collaboration during an exam will be considered
cheating. Any student who is caught cheating will be given an E in the
course and referred to the University Student Behavior
Committee. Please don't take that chance - if you're having trouble
understanding the material, please let us know and we will be more
than happy to help.

**Anti-Harassment:** The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of
thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central
to the aims and goals of a this course. These require a community and
an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and
group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and
that embraces diversity. Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome
in any part of this course. This includes: speech or behavior that
intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s
participation or opportunity for participation in the conference. We
aim for this course to be an environment where harassment in any form
does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on
race, gender, religion, age, color, national origin, ancestry,
disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment
includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact,
and unwelcome sexual attention. Please contact an instructor or CS
staff member if you have questions or if you feel you are the victim
of harassment (or otherwise witness harassment of others). (Adapted
