# Survey of related work, and plans for data

For the [course project](README.md) for [CL1 Fall 2019](https://github.com/hal3/cl1f19umd), the second deliverable is a survey of related work to your chosen project's topic, as well as a detailed plan for where and how you will get data.

Please submit a two page document; only one member of each team should submit.

The first page should be a survey of related work. Take a look at JT Leek's [Reading Academic Papers](https://github.com/jtleek/readingpapers) page for some thoughts. Please balance how you like, but we expect that most surveys will cover 3-6 papers. Do not feel obligated to find a huge number, but also spend some time looking for at least one from before 2010. If you need help, feel free to reach out to one of the course staff. For each paper you survey, you should explain how it is similar/different from what you are doing, what the key idea/claim is in that paper, and how the paper supports that claim.

The second page should be a discussion of where you will get data. If you are using precollected data, this "page" might just be three lines long, in which you point us to the appropriate data resources. If you are collecting your own data, please write at most half a page describing how you will collect it, annotate it, and expected costs.
