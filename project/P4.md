# Prototype/baseline implementation and initial results

For the [course project](README.md) for [CL1 Fall 2019](https://github.com/hal3/cl1f19umd), the fourth (and penultimate) deliverable is a report (and, where appropriate data and code submission) of an initial implementation or baseline for your project.

This is a short, 1 page writeup. In it, you should describe
1. a very simple baseline approach to your problem
1. the data you're running on
1. how you're evaluating
1. what results you are getting with the baseline approach.

If there's an easy skyline approach for your project, please also provide those results.

The goal of this baseline is mostly to make sure that you have something functioning end-to-end --- i.e., you start with data on one end, and you get an accuracy/score/whatever on the other end. For the rest of the project you'll be trying to make the middle part better.

Grading: 25% for each of (1)-(4) above.
